# LinkedIn Job Saver
## Overview
Hello, I'm Mert, and today marks Day 49 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. Welcome to the LinkedIn Job Saver project. In this project, we've developed a Python script that automates the process of saving job listings on LinkedIn. The script signs in to LinkedIn, navigates to the Jobs page, iterates through job listings, and saves each listing for later review.

## Project Description
The script utilizes the Selenium library to interact with the LinkedIn Jobs webpage. It automates the sign-in process, navigates to the Jobs page with specific search criteria, and iterates through job listings to save each listing. The goal is to streamline the process of tracking job opportunities on LinkedIn.

## How to Run
To use the LinkedIn Job Saver script, follow these steps:

* Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
* Install the Selenium library using pip:
```bash
pip install selenium
```
* Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version and place it in the project directory.
* pen the Python script: main.py.
* Customize the script by providing your LinkedIn credentials (email and password).
Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
* Sit back and watch as the bot automates the process of saving job listings on LinkedIn.
